# Shared Kitchen Reservation Platform

## Project Scope  
This project aims to build a secure and user-friendly reservation platform for a shared kitchen space in a cancer hospital. The platform allows patients and their families to view kitchen spot availability and book time slots for self-cooking, addressing the lack of suitable dining options for individuals with special dietary needs. It also ensures privacy, accessibility, and compliance with healthcare data standards.
